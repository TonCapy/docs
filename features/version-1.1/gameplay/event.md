# Event

**Spin Event** rankings are based on the number of spins in a day (24 hours).

**Bush Event** rankings depend on the total time spent occupying a Bush in a day.

**Top Level Competitions**:

* Entry Fee: Energy-based (50e, 100e, 200e)
* Basic Rewards: Scaled according to entry fee (800e, 1,600e, 3,200e)
* Additional Rewards: Calculated as 5% of total entry fees collected from all users.

_**\*NOTE**_

If a user only uses energy to join the **Spin or Bush Events** but **does not actively participate in Spin or Bush** activities, they **will not be considered as having participated** in the event. The initial energy spent to enter the event **will not be refunded**.
