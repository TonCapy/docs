# Airdrop In-app

### &#x20;_Key elements of the strategy include:_

1. **Activity-Based Rewards**:
   * Airdrops will be distributed based on user activity within the app, with conversion rates calculated periodically.
   * User snapshots will be taken at specific intervals to record activity and determine eligibility for token distribution.
2. **Phased Distribution**:
   * The airdrop campaign will be divided into four phases over the first year.
   * 50% of the tokenomics is allocated to airdrops, emphasizing user acquisition, retention, and creating dedicated fan users for the ecosystem.
3. **Milestone-Based Launch**:
   * The initial distribution of in-app tokens will coincide with the launch of Ting Chainâ€™s testnet and mainnet.

By aligning token distribution with significant ecosystem milestones, TonCapy ensures that users are incentivized to actively participate in the ecosystem while laying the foundation for long-term community growth.
