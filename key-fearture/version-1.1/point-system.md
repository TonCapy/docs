# Point System

**Points** help players improve their ranking, redeem rewards, unlock special features, participate in airdrops, and support their tribe, creating motivation for engagement and enhancing the game experience.

Players can collect points through the following activities

* **Participating in in-game activities**: Playing games like Spin and Bush rewards players with points.
* **Completing daily tasks**: Daily check-ins and task completion earn additional points.
* **Joining events**: Participating in special events and achieving high ranks will grant bonus points.
* **Inviting friends**: Bringing new friends into Ton Capy is also a quick way to earn points.
