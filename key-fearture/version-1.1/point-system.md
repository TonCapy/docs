# Point System

In the **TonCapy Point System**, accumulating points is essential, as it directly impacts the number of tokens users receive during airdrops. **The more points you have, the greater your token allocation will be** when the airdrop occurs. This system incentivizes active participation, encouraging users to engage in various activities to maximize their points and boost potential rewards in the TonCapy ecosystem.

Players can collect points through the following activities

* **Participating in in-game activities**: Playing games like Spin and Bush rewards players with points.
* **Completing daily tasks**: Daily check-ins and task completion earn additional points.
* **Joining events**: Participating in special events and achieving high ranks will grant bonus points.
* **Inviting friends**: Bringing new friends into TonCapy is also a quick way to earn points.
